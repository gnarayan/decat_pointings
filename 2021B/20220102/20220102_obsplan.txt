 -10 degree twilight, the telescope observer on the montain will start the
 pointing correction at that time.
********  IMPORTANT!!!! ****** 
The Asteroid fields are very far to the West, therefore it's good to check the
pointing of the telescope at the beginning of the night to the West, so the
telescope dome does not have to rotate much, but do not check the pointing at
the fields as they are too far over for that. Pls tell this to telescope
observer on the mountain!!! 
***
As soon the pointing correction is done, start the Asteroid fields:
jsons/2021B-0909_Twilight_Sheppard/SheppardTwilight15decevening.json
at -14 degree twilight (21:54 local time), stop the observations, and go to the next field!

Try to get through these three targets if possible. 
If that means dropping i bands and just getting g,r thats better than missing a full pointing
